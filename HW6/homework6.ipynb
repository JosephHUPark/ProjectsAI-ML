","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Task 2 Part 1**\n\nAutonomous Vehicle Navigation\nImagine an autonomous vehicle (AV) that needs to navigate through a city. The actions the vehicle can take at each location include moving north, south, east, west, or staying in place. The outcomes of these actions are partly deterministic and partly stochastic due to factors like weather, traffic conditions, and road closures.\n\nStates (S): Each road represents a state that the AV can be in. The could also be special states like the vehicle's destination or hazardous locations to avoid.\n\nActions (A): At each state, the vehicle can choose from a set of actions: move north, south, east, west, or stay in place.\n\nTransition Probabilities (T): These is a chance that taking an action in a state will lead to a particular subsequent state. For example, if the vehicle decides to move north, there couold be a high probability of successfully moving north, but there's also a small chance that it might stay in place due to traffic or move to a different adjacent state due to slippery roads.\n\nRewards (R): Each action taken by the vehicle results in a reward or penalty. Moving closer to the destination might result in a positive reward, while moving into a traffic jam or hazardous location might result in a penalty. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, effectively guiding the vehicle to the destination efficiently and safely.\n\nDecision-Making Process:\nThe autonomous vehicle uses the MDP framework to make decisions at each step. The vehicle chooses the action that maximizes its expected reward, using only its current location and rewards process while taking into account the future states it might end up in. The vehicle continuously updates its decisions as it navigates through the city, adapting to new situations (like sudden road closures or changes in traffic conditions) by reassessing its options at each state according to the MDP model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Task 2 Part 2**\n\nReinforcement learning has always been a substandard alternative to its counterpart, neural networks. However, over the recent years, reinforcement learning has been gaining a lot of attention for all of its successes.\n\nOne of the many applications for reinforcement learning is autonomous drone control. Paper can be found here: https://web.stanford.edu/class/aa228/reports/2019/final62.pdf\n\nUsing a quadcoptor, Stanford's research team has made it so that it is capable of picking a target and moving there efficiently. This can help solve problems such as victim searching after natural disasters, when people are unable to go into a dangerous place because of the risk - drones would be much more averse to these problems. Perhaps, if the environment were a fallen building and there are survivors trapped inside, the drone would reward itself if it gets closer to signs of survivors such as cries for help or their general existence. The environmental states would correspond to its own environment as well. For example, walls with risks of falling or crumbling would return higher probabilities of being  avoided to the drone. \n\nThe stanford paper I have linked above only shows a rudimentary version of this problem: a drone that picks out a target and flies over to it. However, in the future, the applications for this could be enormous.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
